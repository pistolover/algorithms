//Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.
//
//Note: 
//You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
//
//Follow up:
//What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
//
//Hint:
//
//Try to utilize the property of a BST.
//What if you could modify the BST node's structure?
//The optimal runtime complexity is O(height of BST).
